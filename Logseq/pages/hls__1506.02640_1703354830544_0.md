- Our system divides the input image into an S × S grid. If the center of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for detecting that object.

- We use sum-squared error because it is easy to optimize, however it does not perfectly align with our goal of maximizing average precision.

- Also, in every image many grid cells do not contain any object. This pushes the “conﬁdence” scores of those cells towards zero, often overpowering the gradient from cells that do contain objects. This can lead to model instability, causing training to diverge early on.

- YOLO predicts multiple bounding boxes per grid cell. At training time we only want one bounding box predictor to be responsible for each object. We assign one predictor to be “responsible” for predicting an object based on which prediction has the highest current IOU with the ground truth. This leads to specialization between the bounding box predictors. Each predictor gets better at predicting certain sizes, aspect ratios, or classes of object, improving overall recall.

- Our learning rate schedule is as follows: For the ﬁrst epochs we slowly raise the learning rate from 10−3 to 10−2. If we start at a high learning rate our model often diverges due to unstable gradients. We continue training with 10−2 for 75 epochs, then 10−3 for 30 epochs, and ﬁnally 10−4 for 30 epochs

- YOLO imposes strong spatial constraints on bounding box predictions since each grid cell only predicts two boxes and can only have one class. This spatial constraint limits the number of nearby objects that our model can predict. Our model struggles with small objects that appear in groups, such as ﬂocks of birds

- Since our model learns to predict bounding boxes from data, it struggles to generalize to objects in new or unusual aspect ratios or conﬁgurations.

- The grid design enforces spatial diversity in the bounding box predictions. Often it is clear which grid cell an object falls in to and the network only predicts one box for each object. However, some large objects or objects near the border of multiple cells can be well localized by multiple cells. Non-maximal suppression can be used to ﬁx these multiple detections. While not critical to performance as it is for R-CNN or DPM, non-maximal suppression adds 23% in mAP

- Unlike sliding window and region proposal-based techniques, YOLO sees the entire image during training and test time so it implicitly encodes contextual information about classes as well as their appearance. Fast R-CNN, a top detection method [14], mistakes background patches in an image for objects because it can’t see the larger context. YOLO makes less than half the number of background errors compared to Fast R-CNN.
