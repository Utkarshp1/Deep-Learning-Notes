- Assume a learned feature x from class 1 is given and θi is the angle between x and Wi, it is known that the modified softmax loss requires cos(θ1) > cos(θ2) to correctly classify x. But what if we instead require cos(mθ1) > cos(θ2) where m ≥ 2 is a integer in order to correctly classify x? It is essentially making the decision more stringent than previous, because we require a lower bound4 of cos(θ1) to be larger than cos(θ2).
