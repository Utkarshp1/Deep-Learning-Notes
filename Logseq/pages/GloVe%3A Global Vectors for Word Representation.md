- **Basic Idea**:
	- Can we combine earlier methods of generating words vectors which were based on global co-occurrence statistics/matrix with the local context window based methods such as Word2Vec?
	- Can we explain or explicitly model the syntactic and semantic regularities in the word representation space which is captured using vector arithmetic?
