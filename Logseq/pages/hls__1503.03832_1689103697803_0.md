- Once this embedding has been produced, then the aforementioned tasks become straight-forward: face verification simply involves thresholding the distance between the two embeddings; recognition becomes a k-NN classification problem; and clustering can be achieved using off-theshelf techniques such as k-means or agglomerative clustering.

- Namely, we strive for an embedding f (x), from an image x into a feature space Rd, such that the squared distance between all faces, independent of imaging conditions, of the same identity is small, whereas the squared distance between a pair of face images from different identities is large.

- Generating all possible triplets would result in many triplets that are easily satisfied (i.e. fulfill the constraint in Eq. (1)). These triplets would not contribute to the training and result in slower convergence, as they would still be passed through the network. It is crucial to select hard triplets, that are active and can therefore contribute to improving the model.

- It is infeasible to compute the argmin and argmax across the whole training set. Additionally, it might lead to poor training, as mislabelled and poorly imaged faces would dominate the hard positives and negatives. There are two obvious choices that avoid this issue:

- Generate triplets offline every n steps, using the most recent network checkpoint and computing the argmin and argmax on a subset of the data.

- Generate triplets online. This can be done by selecting the hard positive/negative exemplars from within a mini-batch.

- Selecting the hardest negatives can in practice lead to bad local minima early on in training, specifically it can result in a collapsed model (i.e. f (x) = 0). In order to mitigate this, it helps to select xn i such that

- This compatibility greatly simplifies upgrade paths. E.g. in an scenario where embedding v1 was computed across a large set of images and a new embedding model v2 is being rolled out, this compatibility ensures a smooth transition without the need to worry about version incompatibilities.
